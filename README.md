# saathi

Saathi is a platform that allows people to share their personal stories and experiences with challenges or difficulties they have faced, and to connect with others who have faced similar challenges. The goal of the platform is to provide a space for people to find support, understanding, and resources from others who have firsthand experience with similar issues. By allowing people to post about their problems and connect with others through specific tags or by forming communities, Saathi aims to create a sense of connection and support for people who are struggling and looking for help.
